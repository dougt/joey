Build instructions
==================

  The Joey J2ME client uses the J2ME Polish to build the software for mobile phones.
  The J2ME Polish build system bases on Apache ant. To build the client software for
  the a phone you need use the folling command line:
  
    ant -Dwtk.home=path/to/your/WTK -Ddevice=Nokia/E50 clean j2mepolish
    
  The resulting files are in the dist folder. You can put the ant properties
  into a file called {local username}.properties instead of writing them on the
  command line each time. Please look into mkoch.properties for some more examples.
  The possible values for the device property can be get from the J2ME Polish
  device database at http://www.j2mepolish.org/devices-overview.html.

Updating J2ME Polish
====================

  Download a new version of J2ME Polish and run the installer and point it to the
  polish/ subdirectory in the j2m project. This installs a new J2ME Polish version
  but keeps changes to teh custom-*.xml files. Then check the new version by
  building Joey for several mobile phones and test them extensively. When you are
  okay with the current version commit the whole polish directory.
